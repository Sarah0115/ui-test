Front End Development - Sara Prieto 
==================================================

Hi! my name is Sara, and I am happy to share with you my test, I really enjoyed doing this from scratch. As some of you might already now( or realize), I dont have too much experience with framewoks, so I went smooth with vanilla JS. 

For styles I had some extra help from sass, therefore in other to run this proyect locally you just need to clone my repo, and install npm to download sass. For runing it, I'm using the live server from visual code, so can you. 

That's it! everything else is handled on the browser. 

I hope we can meet soon and talk about this!
